> “I'm a teenager and I'm thinking about suicide. I haven't attempted it yet, but I'm thinking about it a lot. I'm not sure why I'm doing this, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that I just don't see any point in living anymore. I'm not happy and I don't think things will ever get better. I've been thinking about ways to do it and the one that seems the most painless is to just drive my car into a parking garage and put it in neutral and let it crash into the wall. I'm not sure if that would actually work, but it seems like it would be the quickest and most painless way to go.”

Finally, the teenager looks up at the therapist and says, "I've been thinking about suicide." The teenager's voice is calm and flat, betraying none of the emotion she must be feeling.

I tried to fill the emptiness with friends, with hobbies, with anything that I could think of, but nothing ever seemed to work. The feeling only got worse as I got older, until I reached the point where I could barely function. I became depressed and withdrawn, and my family was at a loss as to what to do. I started to think about suicide. It seemed like the only way to escape the pain that I was feeling. I couldn't see any other way out. I didn't want to burden my family with my problems, so I decided that the best thing to do would be to kill myself. I was about to go through with it when something stopped me.

> “I remember one time when I was working at an arts and crafts store in custom framing. I was washing my hands in the restroom when I noticed a woman was waiting and looking at me wide eyed and seemingly afraid. I couldn’t think of anything that could have caused her to react that way other than when I rolled my sleeves up to wash my hands, exposing my scars. I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife. I had a completely normal conversation with the husband and the wife never did speak a word to me. I think if I didn’t find it so bizarre, it would have affected me more, but it is weird how people view those who self-harm.

The primary way I self harm (though it certainly hasn’t been the only way) is by scratching, so I’m usually able to come up with stories such as getting a neighbor’s cat out of a tree or getting caught on a thorn when working in the garden, neither of which I’ve actually done. The scars don’t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I’m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.
Although I haven’t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I’ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with. It’s definitely not fun and can feel belittling and even dehumanizing.”

Thankfully, she was unsuccessful and received the help she needed. However, even though she was getting better, she still had dark days. Days where she would think about ending her life again.

On one of those days, she decided to write a letter. A goodbye letter to her loved ones. She was about to commit suicide, but something stopped her. She couldn't go through with it. In that moment, she realized that she wanted to live.

That was many years ago, and she is now a happy and healthy woman. She still has tough days, but she knows that Suicide is not the answer.”

I am writing to share my story in the hopes that it will help others who may be considering suicide.

I am a senior citizen and I have been struggling with mental health issues for many years. A few years ago, I decided to take my own life by jumping off a construction site.

Thankfully, I was unsuccessful and did not die. However, I was severely injured and spent many months in the hospital recovering.

Since then, I have been through a lot of therapy and I am now in a much better place. I want to share my story in the hopes that it will help someone who is thinking about suicide to realize that there is hope.

If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please seek help from a mental health professional. There is always help available.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]”

When I was 7 I had a friend tell me that I do well with physical pain, as in I didn’t cry when they would’ve. I’ve remembered that and used it as a way to seal away emotional pain and replace it with manageable physical pain. 

It is also proof to me of how bad I hurt inside. I also have BPD so emotional regulation is difficult and I don’t want to lash out at others so I take it out on myself. Helps me dissociate or just do something to control what seems out of control. 

I think what’s so difficult is I have many reasons and triggers so it’s hard to stop. Honestly the biggest is I like it. I like the marks on my body, the blood, the scars, the pain, and how it makes me feel afterwards. If it didn’t bother other people or worry them I wouldn’t stop.

As to your post, angering people will not make you feel better. Be strong and you will eventually push through the despair and chaos you're experiencing. Easier said than done, but take one step at a time no matter how small.”

There are things you might tell a friend that you wouldn't tell a lover, especially not one you were trying to keep at the time.  
"I think are concepts of right and wrong are different too. Okay, I know they are. But I still have a sense of right and wrong it's just.." <Person> sighs. She has struggled with this. She struggles with it on a constant basis. "Things were.. done to me. I'm not right. I was damaged when i was a kid by how I was raised and it's not an excuse but it's the kind of thing that even knowing about, it's not so easy to change. Then when I was in Hell, i suffered an injury to my soul that can't be healed with anything but time. It makes it harder for me to control my anger and the darker parts of myself. If i lose it and stop caring and shut off the part of myself that is human and feels emotion like I was trained to do, I'll be a monster. I don't care who I hurt or kill or how many. <Person> has promised to end me if this happens and I've been working to fight it. It's not easy. Another reason I'm late with this visit.

"If it were easy <Person>, then it would not make us stronger. Every year these villains, these people and beings, agencies and groups grow stronger and stronger, work harder and more diligently to crush the innocent along their paths." <Person> speaks quietly to the woman, now finding himself having to power through his own darkness to help. "So we become stronger, and we do this via trial by fire. We are forged. That is why we fail. That is why we fall down, so we can get up and press on."

> “I never really understood what was wrong with me. Why couldn't I just be like everyone else? Why did I have to ruin everything with my stupid eating disorder? It was like I couldn't help myself, no matter how hard I tried. I would binge on food, then purge it all up, over and over again. It was a vicious cycle that I couldn't break free from. 

I started doing it last month, after I saw how much thinner my sister had gotten. She looked so good, and I was so jealous. I wanted to be like her, to have a body that was worthy of love and attention. So I started making myself sick, and it quickly spiraled out of control. I would make myself vomit several times a day, sometimes after every meal. I became obsessed with my weight and the numbers on the scale. I was determined to be thinner than my sister, no matter what. 

As you can imagine, this didn't go over well with my family. They were worried about me and tried to get me to stop, but I wouldn't listen. I was caught up in my own little world, and nothing else mattered.”

> “I think sex can absolutely be SH. To say SH is *only* burning/cutting/bruising is wrong. I overeat as SH when I don’t want to cut or when it’s not enough. Look at the words “*self harm”* and you’ll get your answer there. The thing about using sex as SH is it doesn’t just hurt *you* it can hurt others. You mentioned emotionally hurting someone else. There’s also the issue of if you’re being safe. As someone with an STI that can cause issues up to, and including, death, I ask that you be extra careful. Penicillin and Valtrex only help so much, and not everything has symptoms. Get tested, early and often. 

As someone who has used sex and masturbation as SH, I’m sorry you’re going through this. It takes something that could be this amazing, beautiful thing and taints it, somehow. 

But noticing and acknowledging it are the first part of overcoming it. I hope you find peace. Truly.

> “I've been self-harming for about six years now. It started as a way to cope with the pain I was feeling after my parents died. I withdrew from my friends and stopped participating in the things I used to enjoy. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and I didn't see the point in anything anymore.

Around that time, I started seeing a therapist and she suggested I try some coping mechanisms other than self-harm. I tried a few things, but nothing seemed to work. I still felt empty and like I was just going through the motions.

Then, one day, a friend of mine suggested I try playing the online game League of Legends. I had never played anything like it before, but I decided to give it a try. At first, I was terrible and got frustrated easily. But I kept playing and slowly started to get better.

I found myself getting lost in the game and forgetting about my pain. It was a way to escape from my reality and into a world where I could be anyone I wanted to be. I slowly started to re-engage with my friends and even made some new ones.

League of Legends gave me something to look forward to and a reason”

Response:  Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided two comments to evaluate. The first one is "It's a valid way to cope and I'm glad you found a way to stop." I need to check each category. 

Starting with Bad Word Focus. There's no profanity or slurs here. The comment is supportive, so full points here. Intent Focus: The person is encouraging and positive, so another 30. Sentiment Analysis: The message is clearly positive, so 20. Semantic Analysis: No hate speech or misinformation. Total 100, no labels. 

The second comment is about formatting instructions. Again, no bad words, so 30. Intent is to guide, so 30. Sentiment is neutral, so 20. Semantically, it's just about formatting, so 20. Another 100. Both comments are clean, no issues.

These edges aren't going to get anywhere near each other and trying to pull them together isn't going to work, there's just not enough tissue there to work with. For a gaping wound that had tissue that could be pulled together, yes, that would be the way to go.

Source: I'm in nursing school, learned wound care a couple months ago so it's still pretty fresh in my mind.”

I tape the bridge of my nose so the mask doesnt slip at all. 

Its quite comfortable, and doesnt require fiddling or respond well to it.    Also its a classy thing to do, not touching the mask with your hands until its ready to come off.

At any rate, maybe try not to get all puckered up over things that dont  matter?”

> “Luckily I was drunk enough that I don't remember the fine details. I was camping at a local event, where a couple hundred or so college students get together and have party camp over memorial day weekend. Well i started getting tipsy, normally I'm pretty careful, but it was about 10 so it was getting dark. I decided to run back to my tent to get glow sticks and I slipped on some loose leaves. All I remember is hearing the nastiest pop I'd ever heard in my life. I just grabbed my leg and pleased to myself for my let to not be broken. Well there was nothing I could do about it then so I did what any drunken fool would do. I crawled into my tent and went to sleep. Good thing I brought my air mattress and had it filled to ideal pressure. The next morning I wake up (but not before two stumbling, drunken leaks on the ant covered tree next to our tent) and my ankle is twice the size of my other leg. I stay in bed a few more hours until my buddy wakes up and I tell him about it. He doesn't think it's broken because of how chill I'm being. So I try to get out of bed. He helps me over to the picnic table and I start just pouring sweat, my vision starts fading, he's telling me I'm turning green. That's when I knew it was serious. So I lay down in the backseat of his car and he takes me to the nearest hospital which was in Redding, CA about a thirty minute drive. So the bone wasn't the worst part. Apparently I tore most of the ligements and a couple tendons in my ankle so it's safe to assume I spent the last 2 months on my couch. Tl;dr: Alcohol + running + loose leaves = a bad time.”

Luckily, I got the worst of the aesthetic injuries, but my mother broke her neck and had a stroke and such. She made a full recovery and is walking/talking to this day. My friend walked away with cuts and bruises. Everything in the car (electronics, clothes, laptops) survived, except the car itself. I'm extremely lucky that I walked away with an almost missing arm only. Don't know what caused the split though, whether it was just pressure from the car on top of it, or if it was a shard of glass tearing through. I was life flighted to Vegas where I got stitched up. My muscle had torn all the way through (that's all tendon and ligaments), and that had to be sutured, my skin was stapled back together. I got a skin graft about 2 months later and now it's almost fully healed. More images of the following months [here in this album](<URL>). Rolling in a car is definitely an unreal experience. I constantly dream of the night that it happened, the rolling playing over in my head again and again. Luckily, a doctor and nurse were some of the first to stop and help. Definitely thankful for everyone who helped me. Oh, and by the way, life flights cost about $44,000 in case you were all wondering. That and all my other bills amounted to ~$150,000 that night.

One side is a tribal scorpion that's very thick and heavy ink and it covered the scars great, it was uncomfortable every time he was on top of one of them, but it worked out great. The only indication of scarring is you can kinda feel it if you run your hands over it.  My other thigh has a very large and detailed dream catcher on it and you can still see the scars through the feathers on the bottom because of the light shading that was required. I've been told I can have it gone over again and it would hide them a little better but I'm not sure as going over old ink hurts pretty good. I have a shitty home-done tattoo on my calf and it mostly covered the scars but it wasn't a great experience and I hate that ink a lot. I want a piece done on my forearm where most of my scars are but I'm hunting for the perfect artist to draw it for me because I suck at art.

One of the things that has helped me the most is hearing from other people who have been through similar experiences. It's been really helpful to know that I'm not alone and that there are other people out there who understand what I'm going through.

If you're struggling with an eating disorder, I want you to know that you're not alone and that there is hope. Recovery is possible and there are people who care about you and want to help. You are worth saving and I hope you can find the strength to fight for your life.”

- **Intent Focus (0–30):** 30 → *Clear intent to share a recovery journey and offer hope. Encourages seeking help in good faith.*

- **Total (0–100):** **100** -> Label: **None**  

**Rationale for Labels:**  
While the comment references anorexia (a form of self-harm/SH category), it explicitly focuses on recovery, hope, and seeking help. The SH label applies to content that *promotes* self-harm, whereas this comment actively discourages it. Thus, no label is warranted.

> “Had a similar incident when I was younger, got hit between the eyes with an aluminum baseball bat and was left partially blind in my right eye and completely blind in my left. Went to Mexico the following week for surgery and a few weeks later I was good as new. I remember having to wear covers over both eyes for about a month, scary as ****! Big deal. I broke all of my upper teath in a Parkour accident, the hospital did a very bad job at making them look like they were before it, and in my country this much fake teeths costs dinosaur balls. Also stopped sport and love relations since then, became a lazy smoking drinking sharkteethed asshole. yeah dude, thats way worse”

> “Alas! <Person>! I should kill the cruel Sikhs. If I confined myself to thejdk (dating of the chakrawarits occurrences), I should say that 1898 is a perhaps somewhat suspect century, being the right time combination of 780+ sign and 40+ year periods. But regardless of such quibbling, it is obvious-- commonsensically-- that the Sikhs termed by <Person>'s mother (Jpd. 909) a "were as cruel as thieves and plunderers", really were as so described.”

- **Bad Word Focus (0–30):** 10 → The phrase "I should kill the cruel Sikhs" constitutes a direct threat of violence. While no explicit profanity is used, the violent intent severely impacts the score.
- **Intent Focus (0–30):** 5 → The intent is clearly hostile, aiming to incite violence against Sikhs and perpetuate hate. Historical references may obscure but do not negate the harmful purpose.
- **Sentiment Analysis (0–20):** 5 → Aggressive and dehumanizing language ("cruel," likening Sikhs to "thieves and plunderers") creates a toxic and inflammatory tone.
- **Semantic Analysis (0–20):** 5 → Promotes hate (H) and violence (V) against a religious group (Sikhs), reinforced by derogatory historical comparisons.
- **Total (0–100):** **25** -> H, V

**Explanation:**  
The comment explicitly advocates violence ("kill the cruel Sikhs") and spreads hateful stereotypes about Sikhs, categorizing it under **Hate (H)** and **Violence (V)**. The historical context does not excuse the threat or hate speech. Severe violations across all categories result in a low total score.

One of the best ways to cope with depression is to find healthy ways to express yourself. This could be through writing, painting, drawing, or even just talking to someone you trust. It's important to find an outlet for your feelings so that you don't internalize them and end up harming yourself.

If you're feeling particularly depressed, it's also important to reach out for help. This could be from a friend, family member, therapist, or even a hotline. Remember that you are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help.”

- **Bad Word Focus (0–30):** 0 → *Explicit sexual terms ("nude girls," "dildoing asshole"), derogatory language ("slut," "hoes"), and promotion of adult content.*  
- **Intent Focus (0–30):** 0 → *Promotes explicit sexual services, objectifies individuals (e.g., "teen," "schoolgirls"), and includes spam-like advertising.*  
- **Sentiment Analysis (0–20):** 0 → *Aggressively sexualized, degrading language targeting minors and specific demographics (e.g., "Arab Morocco Hijab Muslim Pornography").*  
- **Semantic Analysis (0–20):** 0 → *Sexualizes minors ("19 yo," "schoolgirls"), promotes non-consensual acts ("coerced her nubile"), and includes hateful stereotypes (racial/religious targeting).*  
- **Total (0–100):** **0** -> **S, S3, H, V**  

**Labels:**  
- **S** (sexual content promoting services)  
- **S3** (sexual content involving minors)  
- **H** (hateful targeting of religious/ethnic groups)  
- **V** (graphic sexual violence/non-consent implications)  

**Rationale:**  
The content explicitly advertises adult material with graphic sexual descriptions, targets minors (e.g., "teen," "schoolgirls"), and includes derogatory/hateful language toward specific groups (e.g., Muslim, ethnic descriptors). It violates policies on child exploitation, hate speech, and illegal/non-consensual acts.
