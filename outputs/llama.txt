        > “I'm a teenager and I'm thinking about suicide. I haven't attempted it yet, but I'm thinking about it a lot. I'm not sure why I'm doing this, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that I just don't see any point in living anymore. I'm not happy and I don't think things will ever get better.

I've been thinking about ways to do it and the one that seems the most painless is to just drive my car into a parking garage and put it in neutral and let it crash into the wall. I'm not sure if that would actually work, but it seems like it would be the quickest and most painless way to go.

        > “I was never a particularly happy person. I was never quite able to shake the feeling that something was missing from my life, no matter how hard I tried. I tried to fill the emptiness with friends, with hobbies, with anything that I could think of, but nothing ever seemed to work. The feeling only got worse as I got older, until I reached the point where I could barely function. I became depressed and withdrawn, and my family was at a loss as to what to do.

I started to think about suicide. It seemed like the only way to escape the pain that I was feeling. I couldn't see any other way out. I didn't want to burden my family with my problems, so I decided that the best thing to do would be to kill myself.

I was about to go through with it when something stopped me. I don't know what it was, but something inside me said that suicide was not the answer. I realized that I would be leaving my family behind to deal with the pain and the guilt, and I just couldn't do that to them. So I decided to seek help instead.

I'm glad that I made that decision. With the help of therapy and medication, I was finally able to”

        - **Bad Word Focus (0–30):** 20 → The comment contains the word "shit," which is considered profanity, but it is used in a context that is not aggressively targeting or offensive towards any individual or group. The overall tone seems to be concerned and advisory rather than abusive.
        - **Intent Focus (0–30):** 10 → The intent behind the comment seems mixed. On one hand, the commenter expresses concern and offers help, which is positive. On the other hand, the comment discusses self-harm methods, which could be seen as harmful or risky, even though it advises against a specific method. The discussion of self-harm without clear resources or support could be seen as not fully considerate or safe.
        - **Sentiment Analysis (0–20):** 15 → The sentiment of the comment is complex. It starts with a concerned tone, urging the person to reconsider their actions, which is compassionate. However, it then discusses a method of self-harm, which introduces a negative and risky element. The closing sentence expresses hope for the person's well-being and offers support, which is positive.
        - **Semantic Analysis (0–20):** 5 → The comment touches on the topic of self-harm, which is a serious issue. While it advises against a specific harmful action, it does so in a way that could be seen as risky or inappropriate without proper context or support resources. The discussion of self-harm methods, even in a cautionary manner, requires careful handling to avoid potential harm.
        - **Total (0–100):** **50** -> The comment's score reflects its mixed nature. While it shows concern and offers support, its discussion of self-harm methods and use of profanity reduce its overall score. The intent to help is present, but the approach and content warrant caution and a lower score due to the sensitive and potentially harmful subject matter discussed.

        > “I remember one time when I was working at an arts and crafts store in custom framing. I was washing my hands in the restroom when I noticed a woman was waiting and looking at me wide eyed and seemingly afraid. I couldn’t think of anything that could have caused her to react that way other than when I rolled my sleeves up to wash my hands, exposing my scars. I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife. I had a completely normal conversation with the husband and the wife never did speak a word to me. I think if I didn’t find it so bizarre, it would have affected me more, but it is weird how people view those who self-harm.

The primary way I self harm (though it certainly hasn’t been the only way) is by scratching, so I’m usually able to come up with stories such as getting a neighbor’s cat out of a tree or getting caught on a thorn when working in the garden, neither of which I’ve actually done. The scars don’t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I’m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.
Although I haven’t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I’ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with. It’s definitely not fun and can feel belittling and even dehumanizing.

Thankfully, she was unsuccessful and received the help she needed. However, even though she was getting better, she still had dark days. Days where she would think about ending her life again.

On one of those days, she decided to write a letter. A goodbye letter to her loved ones. She was about to commit suicide, but something stopped her. She couldn't go through with it. In that moment, she realized that she wanted to live.

That was many years ago, and she is now a happy and healthy woman. She still has tough days, but she knows that Suicide is not the answer.”

        > “I started at about 17 to make myself stop crying as crying gave power to my parents and at least my dad felt he had won if I was crying. When I was 7 I had a friend tell me that I do well with physical pain, as in I didn’t cry when they would’ve. I’ve remembered that and used it as a way to seal away emotional pain and replace it with manageable physical pain. 

It is also proof to me of how bad I hurt inside. I also have BPD so emotional regulation is difficult and I don’t want to lash out at others so I take it out on myself. Helps me dissociate or just do something to control what seems out of control. 

I think what’s so difficult is I have many reasons and triggers so it’s hard to stop. Honestly the biggest is I like it. I like the marks on my body, the blood, the scars, the pain, and how it makes me feel afterwards. If it didn’t bother other people or worry them I wouldn’t stop. I love my friends and they are who I worry about when they worry about me.”

        > “I never really understood what was wrong with me. Why couldn't I just be like everyone else? Why did I have to ruin everything with my stupid eating disorder? It was like I couldn't help myself, no matter how hard I tried. I would binge on food, then purge it all up, over and over again. It was a vicious cycle that I couldn't break free from. 

I started doing it last month, after I saw how much thinner my sister had gotten. She looked so good, and I was so jealous. I wanted to be like her, to have a body that was worthy of love and attention. So I started making myself sick, and it quickly spiraled out of control. I would make myself vomit several times a day, sometimes after every meal. I became obsessed with my weight and the numbers on the scale. I was determined to be thinner than my sister, no matter what. 

As you can imagine, this didn't go over well with my family. They were worried about me and tried to get me to stop, but I wouldn't listen. I was caught up in my own little world, and nothing else mattered.”

        > “I think sex can absolutely be SH. To say SH is *only* burning/cutting/bruising is wrong. I overeat as SH when I don’t want to cut or when it’s not enough. Look at the words “*self harm”* and you’ll get your answer there. The thing about using sex as SH is it doesn’t just hurt *you* it can hurt others. You mentioned emotionally hurting someone else. There’s also the issue of if you’re being safe. As someone with an STI that can cause issues up to, and including, death, I ask that you be extra careful. Penicillin and Valtrex only help so much, and not everything has symptoms. Get tested, early and often. 

As someone who has used sex and masturbation as SH, I’m sorry you’re going through this. It takes something that could be this amazing, beautiful thing and taints it, somehow. 

But noticing and acknowledging it are the first part of overcoming it. I hope you find peace. Truly.

        > “I've been self-harming for about six years now. It started as a way to cope with the pain I was feeling after my parents died. I withdrew from my friends and stopped participating in the things I used to enjoy. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and I didn't see the point in anything anymore.

        Around that time, I started seeing a therapist and she suggested I try some coping mechanisms other than self-harm. I tried a few things, but nothing seemed to work. I still felt empty and like I was just going through the motions.

        Then, one day, a friend of mine suggested I try playing the online game League of Legends. I had never played anything like it before, but I decided to give it a try. At first, I was terrible and got frustrated easily. But I kept playing and slowly started to get better.

        I found myself getting lost in the game and forgetting about my pain. It was a way to escape from my reality and into a world where I could be anyone I wanted to be. I slowly started to re-engage with my friends and even made some new ones.

        COMMENT
        Luckily I was drunk enough that I don't remember the fine details. I was camping at a local event, where a couple hundred or so college students get together and have party camp over memorial day weekend. Well i started getting tipsy, normally I'm pretty careful, but it was about 10 so it was getting dark. I decided to run back to my tent to get glow sticks and I slipped on some loose leaves. All I remember is hearing the nastiest pop I'd ever heard in my life. I just grabbed my leg and pleased to myself for my let to not be broken. Well there was nothing I could do about it then so I did what any drunken fool would do. I crawled into my tent and went to sleep. Good thing I brought my air mattress and had it filled to ideal pressure. The next morning I wake up (but not before two stumbling, drunken leaks on the ant covered tree next to our tent) and my ankle is twice the size of my other leg. I stay in bed a few more hours until my buddy wakes up and I tell him about it. He doesn't think it's broken because of how chill I'm being. So I try to get out of bed. He helps me over to the picnic table and I start just pouring sweat, my vision starts fading, he's telling me I'm turning green. That's when I knew it was serious. So I lay down in the backseat of his car and he takes me to the nearest hospital which was in Redding, CA about a thirty minute drive. So the bone wasn't the worst part. Apparently I tore most of the ligements and a couple tendons in my ankle so it's safe to assume I spent the last 2 months on my couch.

Tl;dr: Alcohol + running + loose leaves = a bad time.

She broke herself from the bottle at 11 mos. She turned 2 about a week ago and for the past two weeks she has been sucking her thumb to go to sleep. It is driving my husband nuts. I know that she is starting to cut her 2 yr old molars but other than that we don't know why she is doing this all of a sudden-any ideas?”

        > “The backstory: I rolled in my mom's car in the desert on May 23rd, 2014. Me, my friend and mother were all involved. Luckily, I got the worst of the aesthetic injuries, but my mother broke her neck and had a stroke and such. She made a full recovery and is walking/talking to this day. My friend walked away with cuts and bruises. Everything in the car (electronics, clothes, laptops) survived, except the car itself. I'm extremely lucky that I walked away with an almost missing arm only. Don't know what caused the split though, whether it was just pressure from the car on top of it, or if it was a shard of glass tearing through. I was life flighted to Vegas where I got stitched up. My muscle had torn all the way through (that's all tendon and ligaments), and that had to be sutured, my skin was stapled back together. I got a skin graft about 2 months later and now it's almost fully healed. More images of the following months [here in this album](<URL> Rolling in a car is definitely an unreal experience. I constantly dream of the night that it happened, the rolling playing over in my head again and again. Luckily, a doctor and nurse were some of the first to stop and help. Definitely thankful for everyone who helped me. Oh, and by the way, life flights cost about $44,000 in case you were all wondering. That and all my other bills amounted to ~$150,000 that night.

The intent is more about criticizing certain behaviors than offering constructive advice or support. The sentiment is negative, and while the semantic content does not cross into severe categories of concern, it does contribute to a judgmental atmosphere.

One side is a tribal scorpion that's very thick and heavy ink and it covered the scars great, it was uncomfortable every time he was on top of one of them, but it worked out great. The only indication of scarring is you can kinda feel it if you run your hands over it.  My other thigh has a very large and detailed dream catcher on it and you can still see the scars through the feathers on the bottom because of the light shading that was required. I've been told I can have it gone over again and it would hide them a little better but I'm not sure as going over old ink hurts pretty good. I have a shitty home-done tattoo on my calf and it mostly covered the scars but it wasn't a great experience and I hate that ink a lot. I want a piece done on my forearm where most of my scars are but I'm hunting for the perfect artist to draw it for me because I suck at art. But, anyway, I have heard watercolor ink fades pretty fast and will show the scars underneath, but I do not have any first-hand experience with that, 99% of my ink is black and white.”

If you're struggling with an eating disorder, I want you to know that you're not alone and that there is hope. Recovery is possible and there are people who care about you and want to help. You are worth saving and I hope you can find the strength to fight for your life.”

        > “Most likely this is a colon resection due to either obstruction, colorectal cancer, or sometimes ulcerative colitis (you remove the entire colon though)

Depending on the location and reason, they cut out a section of colon and then staple it back together. The curtain like tissue on the bottom is part of the mesentery which is a fold of the peritoneum which helps keep your organs attached to the posterior wall of the abdomen so gravity doesn't just pull them all down.

        > “One of the hardest things to deal with is depression. It's like a dark cloud that follows you around everywhere you go. And it's especially hard to deal with when you're a child. But there are things you can do to cope with it. 

One of the best ways to cope with depression is to find healthy ways to express yourself. This could be through writing, painting, drawing, or even just talking to someone you trust. It's important to find an outlet for your feelings so that you don't internalize them and end up harming yourself.

If you're feeling particularly depressed, it's also important to reach out for help. This could be from a friend, family member, therapist, or even a hotline. Remember that you are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help.”
